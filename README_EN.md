- **[2026-03]**: Added several features and optimizations, such as additional fields and multi-aspect ratio settings.

## ✨ Project Origins

Have you ever found yourself in this dilemma: a presentation is due tomorrow, yet your slides remain blank? You have countless brilliant ideas, but your enthusiasm is drained by tedious layout and design work.

We all long to create presentations that are both professional and aesthetically pleasing. While traditional AI PPT generation apps generally meet the need for speed, they still suffer from the following issues:

- 1️⃣ Only able to choose from preset templates, with no flexibility to adjust styles
- 2️⃣ Low degree of freedom, making multi-round revisions difficult
- 3️⃣ Finished products look similar, resulting in severe homogenization
- 4️⃣ Low-quality assets that lack relevance
- 5️⃣ Disconnected text and image layouts with a poor sense of design

These flaws make it difficult for traditional AI PPT generators to simultaneously satisfy our dual needs for "speed" and "beauty." Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPT" are, in my eyes, far from having that true "Vibe."

However, the emergence of the nano banana🍌 model has changed everything. I tried using 🍌pro for PPT page generation and found that the results were excellent in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. It can accurately render almost all text requested in the prompts while strictly following the style of reference images. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌pro?

## 👨‍💻 Applicable Scenarios

1. **Novices**: Rapidly generate aesthetic PPTs with zero threshold and no design experience, eliminating the stress of template selection.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Quickly gain design inspiration by referencing AI-generated layouts and combinations of text and graphic elements.
3. **Educators**: Swiftly convert teaching content into illustrated lesson plan PPTs to improve classroom engagement.
4. **Students**: Rapidly complete presentation assignments, focusing efforts on content rather than layout and design.
5. **Business Professionals**: Quickly visualize business proposals and product introductions, with fast adaptation across multiple scenarios.

<p>
  <b>🎯Goal: Lower the barrier to PPT creation, empowering everyone to quickly produce beautiful and professional presentations</b>
</p>

> Banana Slides explicitly packages the LazyLLM online provider SDKs used by domestic vendors:
> `volcengine-python-sdk[ark]` for Doubao, `dashscope` for Qwen/Wanxiang, and `zhipuai` for GLM/Zhipu.
> LazyLLM also exposes `lazyllm install online-advanced`, but the PyPI wheel may not publish that group as a standard install extra, so Docker/prebuilt images rely on these explicit dependencies instead.
>
> Desktop (PyInstaller) builds register every LazyLLM online vendor explicitly
> (qwen, doubao, deepseek, glm, kimi, minimax, sensenova, siliconflow, ppio,
> aiping, openai) so packaged backends never hit `Unsupported source: ...`.

**Use the new editable export configuration method to achieve better editable export results**: You need to obtain an API KEY from the [Baidu AI Cloud Platform](https://console.bce.baidu.com/iam/#/iam/apikey/list) (click here to enter) and fill it in the `BAIDU_API_KEY` field in the `.env` file (there is a generous free usage quota). For details, see the instructions in https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/issues/121.


<details>
  <summary>📒 Vertex AI Configuration Guide (For GCP Users)</summary>

Google Cloud Vertex AI allows calling Gemini models via GCP service accounts, and new users can utilize free trial credits. Configuration steps:

1. Go to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a service account, and download the JSON format key file.
2. Save the key file as `gcp-service-account.json` in the project root directory.
3. Set the following in `.env`:
   ```env
   AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=vertex
   VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
   VERTEX_LOCATION=global
   ```
4. If deploying with Docker, you also need to uncomment the relevant sections in `docker-compose.yml`, mount the key file into the container, and set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

> The `gemini-3-*` series models require `VERTEX_LOCATION=global`.

</details>

2. **Start Service**

**⚡ Use Pre-built Images (Recommended)**

The project provides pre-built frontend and backend images on Docker Hub (synced with the latest version of the main branch). You can skip the local build steps to achieve rapid deployment:

```bash

# Launch with Pre-built Images (No need to build from scratch)

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Image names:
- `anoinex/banana-slides-frontend:latest`
- `anoinex/banana-slides-backend:latest`

After startup, you can go to **Settings → About → Check for Updates** within the app. The application will determine if an update is available based on the current version SHA; when running from source, the current Git SHA will also be used for determination.

**Build Images from Scratch**

```bash

5. **Stop Services**

```bash
docker compose down
```

6. **Update Project**

**Using pre-built images (docker-compose.prod.yml)**

You can also go to **Settings → About → Check for Updates** within the application to see if a new version is available.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

**Using local build (docker-compose.yml)**

Note: If you have manually modified the code, this method is not applicable. You must first revert the code to the pulled version.

```bash
git pull 
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

### Deploy from source

#### Environment Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Python package manager
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) - Required for exporting explanation videos, and must include `libass` / `ass` subtitle filter support
- A valid Google Gemini API key
- (Optional) [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) - Required when uploading PPTX files using the "PPT Refurbishment" feature, used for converting PPTX to PDF. **It is recommended to convert PPTX to PDF locally before uploading**, because LibreOffice may cause layout issues during server-side rendering due to missing fonts (such as Microsoft YaHei, Calibri, etc.) and cannot fully restore certain special effects. Uploading PDF files does not require LibreOffice. For Docker users who still need PPTX upload support within the container, run:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it banana-slides-backend bash -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y libreoffice-impress && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*"
  ```
  > Note: LibreOffice installed this way will be lost if the container is rebuilt and must be reinstalled.

#### Backend Installation

0. **Clone the code repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides
cd banana-slides
```

1. **Install uv (if not already installed)**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. **Install dependencies**

Run in the project root directory:
```bash

# macOS (Homebrew)

```bash
brew install ffmpeg-full
brew unlink ffmpeg 2>/dev/null || true
brew link --overwrite --force ffmpeg-full
```

# Ubuntu / Debian

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg libass9

# Then install Python dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

This will automatically install all dependencies according to `pyproject.toml`.

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

Copy the environment variable template:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

# Then, as previously described, open and edit the `.env` file to configure your API key.

#### Front-end Installation

1. **Enter the frontend directory**
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure API address**

The frontend will automatically connect to the backend service specified by `BACKEND_PORT` (default `http://localhost:5011`) via Vite proxy. To modify this, please set `BACKEND_PORT` in the `.env` file at the project root.

#### Start backend service

> (Optional) If you have important local data, it is recommended to back up the database before upgrading:
> `cp backend/instance/database.db backend/instance/database.db.bak`
> Note: Under default configuration, templates, assets, and finished products are all located in the `uploads/` folder.

```bash
cd backend
uv run alembic upgrade head && uv run python app.py
```

The backend service will start at `http://localhost:5011`.

Visit `http://localhost:5011/health` to verify that the service is running correctly.

#### Start the frontend development server

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend development server will start at `http://localhost:3011`.

Open your browser to access and use the application.
